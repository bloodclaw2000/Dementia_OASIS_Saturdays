# Dementia Prediction from MRI Images using OASIS Dataset
## Overview

This project provides a system for predicting dementia from MRI images using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and random forest classifiers. The system processes MRI images to predict dementia, ensuring a non-discriminatory and privacy-conscious approach. It utilizes a CNN to extract dementia probabilities for each MRI image type, and these probabilities are then combined and enhanced using a random forest model to provide robust and accurate predictions.

## Key Features

* A set of Convolution Neural Networks process MRI images to extract dementia probabilities for different image types.
* Combines the CNN outputs to form a comprehensive prediction model using a random forest classifier.
* Ensures privacy by optionally not requiring personal demographic data.
* Does not require high computational resources, able to be run on laptops or on Colab.

## Origin of Data
This project uses data from ([OASIS-1 DATASET](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/)) aimed at making neuroimaging datasets freely available to the scientific community. This set consists of a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 100 of the included subjects over the age of 60 have been clinically diagnosed with very mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).
